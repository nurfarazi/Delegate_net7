# Delegate .net7

This repository is dedicated to learning and experimenting with C# delegates. It is a terminal application built on .NET 7.

## Key Points about Delegates

- Delegates in C# are reference types that hold references to methods.
- They provide a way to pass methods as parameters to other methods.
- Delegates can be used to implement callbacks and event handling.
- Delegates can be multicast, meaning they can hold references to multiple methods.
- Delegates can be declared using the `delegate` keyword or by using lambda expressions.
- Delegates are commonly used in event-driven programming and asynchronous programming.
- Delegates provide a level of abstraction and flexibility in designing modular and extensible code.
- Delegates can be used to implement the observer pattern and decouple components in an application.
